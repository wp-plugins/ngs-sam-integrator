Plug-in to integrate SAM Broadcaster with your Wordpress site

== Description ==
This plug-in currently includes an automated request system which will allow 
website visitors to browse your song library and request songs by clicking
on them in the library listing.  

It has been tested with and confirmed to work with SAM Broadcaster installations
using the MySQL database system.  Other database systems have not been tested,
nor can this plug-in be verified to support them.  If you find the plug-in
works as-is with other the other database systems which SAM supports, please
let me know.

== Installation ==

BEFORE YOU INSTALL you will need to make sure that the system(s) you are running
SAM Broadcaster and your SAM Database is/are properly configured to allow 
incoming connections.  If you are using non-default ports to run SAM and/or
your MySQL database, you will need to know these port numbers during
configuration.   If you are using the defaults, these values will already be
filled in for you.

Manual Installation Instructions:
1.  Upload the NGS SAM Integrator Plug-In to your Wordpress Site and Activate it
2.  Open the NGS SAM Integrator Settings
3.  Enter Your SAM Broadcaster details including the host address and port 
    where the SAM Broadcaster client is running.
3.  Enter the Connection Details for your SAM Broadcaster Database.

    For security reasons, the "root" user should never be used for this or any 
    other web based application.  For this reason, the plug-in will not allow
    to use "root" as the database user name.  

    It is recommended that you configure a new database user specifically for
    use by the plug-in and only give it SELECT access on your SAM Database.  
    The plug-in does not need, nor would it make use of, any other privileges.
4.  The option for "Show Queue Time" will display a message to inform one of
    seven different messages to give your visitors a general idea of how long
    the queue is, but not a specific queue time.  (Default is YES)
5.  You may manually specify the post ID's of pages you have already set up to
    hold your play list and top requests list.  If these are left blank (or if
    the specified posts do not exist), new posts will automatically be created
    containing the proper shortcodes when you save your options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will I need to make CSS modifications in order for the plug-in to work with my Theme? =

The plug-in minimizes the use of internal formatting, allowing your theme to 
determine as much about the appearance as possible.  This should allow the plug-in
to look nicely integrated with your site, regardless of the theme used, providing
the theme conforms with the standards for Wordpress themes, and makes proper use
of hooks.

All NGS SAM Integrator pages which appear on the front-end of your site are
contained with a div wrapper with the class "ngssamintegrator".  You can modify
the included CSS file to your liking to format these pages, if you desire.

= Does the plug-in support saving configurations for more than one DJ? =

While this is planned for a future version, the current version only supports
saving the details for a single SAM Broadcaster client.

= I have installed and configured the plug-in, but when someone tries to make a request, they get the message "Authorization failed. IP not in allowed list." =

Believe it or not, this message is a good thing.  It means the plug-in is 
properly configured and working.  This message is generated by the SAM 
Broadcaster client, so if you're seeing it, it means that your webserver and 
SAM Broadcaster client are successfully talking to one another.  

For security reasons, SAM Broadcaster will only accept incoming connections from 
IP addresses you permit.  You need to add the IP address of your webserver 
(which will be included in the error message) to SAM Broadcaster's allowed IP 
list.  You can find this under "File->Config->Request Policy" in your SAM 
Broadcaster client.
